#Events
inc.01.t:0 "The People's Front"
inc.01.d:0 "We must move quickly. There are many forces at play in India now, and even as we break away from those who have sought to oppress us, the entire subcontinent has been thrown into uncertainty. The Raj is fracturing; the people it has abused for so long are finally taking back what is theirs. Where the nationalistic rebellion failed, the political and military power they willingly gave us will not. Millions upon millions have already flocked to our flag, and we can be happy to say that all of Bengal is now under our control. This may not last for long, though. The Raj is still dealing with its own collapse, but should it survive, it will seek revenge. And that will mean war against us. Likewise, whatever else births itself from the Raj's corpse will undoubtebly contest our claim to the country. But they forget themselves. This land belongs to the People, not to any foreign empire or economic magnate. The People will guide our reconquest, and lead India into a bright new future."
inc.01.a:0 "Glory to the People!"

inc.02.t:0 "The First People's Congress"
inc.02.d:0 "The greatest socialist figures from across India have gathered today in Dhaka for the first inaugural People's Congress. It might not be accompanied by as much grandeur as we might hope, but these are pressing times. Vultures remain on our doorstep, ready to attack as soon as we show the first sign of weakness. This Congress will be essential to preserving the will of the People and planning our ultimate reconquest of the subcontinent. Its importance cannot be overstated."
inc.02.a:0 "Let the Congress begin!"

inc.10.t:0 "The People's Reconquest of India"
inc.10.d:0 "With India fractured, the empires of the world pick at us like vultures. Only their own infighting has prevented them from seizing the moment to attack and conquer us once more. Divided, India will not stand a chance. But united...we could become the most powerful nation of workers the world has ever seen! The people shall no longer be held down by the chains of their conquerors. Let us mobilize our army, and load our rifles. The Princes that claim dominion over the peoples of India will soon know our wrath, and before long...the people's reconquest of India will succeed."
inc.10.a:0 "Long live India!"
