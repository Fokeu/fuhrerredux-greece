UKR_FUHRERREDUX_DESC:0 "Following the collapse of the Russian Empire, the Ukrainian people sought to establish their own state along the Dnieper river. The German Empire briefly established a client state with the hopes of using Ukraine's vast fields to feed the Imperial Army, but was forced to evacuate the region following the German revolution in 1918. The Ukrainian People's Republic was re-established, and thrown into the chaos of the Russian Civil War. Coming out victorious against the bolsheviks, the Ukrainians seeked to distance themselves from Russia and create a unique Ukrainian identity wedged between Soviet Russia and a resurgent Germany. With tensions once more rising in Europe, Ukraine must place her bets and pick a side, or be lost to the annals of time."

ukraine.1.t:0 "Ukraine in 1936"
ukraine.1.d:0 "After the breakout of the Russian Civil War, the Ukrainian people found themselves thrown into a turmoil that they did not wish to be a part of. For a brief moment during that war, it looked as if we would be subsumed into the growing Soviet state. However, Lenin, ever the pragmatist, in a moment of panic signed away our small state and gave us independence. However, the Russian bear still eyes us hungrily, waiting for a perfect moment to strike. To the West are millions of Western Ukrainians, under various governments, crying out for liberation from foreign tyranny. \n\nAt home, Ukraine is divided between three political factions. The Liberals, popular primarily in Western Ukraine, seek liberalisation of the economy and the state and a geopolitical alignment with Western Europe. The Nationalist OUN, also greatly popular primarily in Western Ukraine, seek a strong militaristic state which will claim Ukraine's Western Lands and find a solution to the Eastern Question. The Socialists, mainly popular in Eastern Ukraine, seek a socialisation of the economy and a geopolitical alignment to the East. Many speak of a fourth faction, the military, as stirrings within the military threaten to boil over at any moment."

Political repression, the quelling of unrest, and the defense of the nation will all be handed over to the military, creating an extremely military oriented state. \n\nKhruschev's plan includes the purging of several officers and thousands of supposedly disloyal soldiers to ensure that the army remains loyal, the formation of a national army from all areas of Ukraine meant to increase the sense of national unity, and the lending of foriegn rifle models. \n\nMakhno's proposal includes the drafting of local militias from towns across Ukraine, and the formation of 'horodyany' with the intention of defending every inch of Ukraine, should an invasion destroy the main bulk of the army."

A new foriegn policy will need to be adapted if we are to survive the upcoming years. \n\nKosier champions a 'realpolitik' stance, arguing that historical rivalries and grudges should be put aside for practical alliances against the true enemies of Ukraine. \n\nKhrushchev wishes to see a rejuvinated alliance with the Russians, and closer cooperation with the soviet government in Moscow. This comes at the risk of possibly being reincoperated into the Russian government, but Khrushchev has ensured the committee that nothing of the sort will happen. \n\nMakhno holds the most radical views, arguing that nobody can be trusted outside of Ukraine, and that alliances with foreign powers will lead only to ruin and despair."

The military, of course, will be the instruments of this plan. \n\nKhrushchev wishes to follow his policy of show trials and purges meant to root out disloyalty to the party and ensure that thre is no opposition within the nation. \n\nMakhno's plan involves the commissioning of 'bluzky', a glorified death squad meant to strike fear into the hearts of the government and people alike. This plan is the most radical of the three, and Khrushchev has personally denounced the plan, calling it 'mad and insane'."

Komsomol member Vasyl is killed by peasants for organizing collectivization.
