### History
PHI_FUHRERREDUX_DESC:0 "For hundreds of years, the Filipino people have been subjugated to oppressive colonial and imperialistic rule; first the Spanish, and now the Americans. The people is thirsty for liberty and freedom their new overlords have paraded itself upon. Now it may finally within their grasp, as the Great Depression weakens the United States; and talks of immediate independence in on the horizon.\nBut what would newly found independence bring; prosperity? or an opportunity to another imperialist power to assert control? One way is certain, the Filipinos needs to viciously defend their freedoms and liberteries, or they will be back to where they came."

philippines.0.t:0 "The Pearl of the Orient, 1936"
philippines.0.d:0 "In 1898, after 333 years of colonization from the Spanish, liberty and independence was finally in the grasp of the Filipinos fighting against oppression; much to their disappointment however, the Americans whom they see as their allies in kicking the Spanish in the archipelago, have opted to annex the Philippines after they bought it from Spain. This resulted in a bloody war between the Americans and Filipino revolutionaries, replacing an oppressor with another.\n\nThe Americans ultimately won, abolishing the first Republic of Emilio Aguinaldo. However, this does not destroy the dreams of the Filipinos of an independent nation, where they are free and with liberty. In 1912, the Jones Act, or the Philippine Autonomy Act was signed by President Theodore Roosevelt replacing the Philippine Organic Act of 1902. This allowed election of members of both the lower and upper houses of the legislature to be elected.\n\nAs the Great Depression weakened the United States, President Herbert Hoover signed the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act of 1933, granting the Philippines independence after a 10-year transition period. This act also allowed the election of a Filipino President and Vice-President, abolishing the position of the American Governor-General but establishing the position of the American High Commissioner. Governor-General Frank Murphy designated July 10, as the election date, with Manuel Luis Quezon of the Nacionalista Party winning.\n\nIn 1936, as the Great Depression continued to plague the American economy, one of the last minute reforms by the Curtis Administration was to grant independence to the Philippines immediately, to ease of expenditure and to lower the effects of the depression; and once again, the dreams of liberty and freedom is in the grasp of the Filipinos."
