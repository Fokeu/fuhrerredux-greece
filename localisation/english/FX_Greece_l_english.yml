#### History ####
GRE_FUHRERREDUX_DESC:0 "With our successful campaign against the Turks, the dream of Megáli Idéa has been realized and our status has been secured. Our Ethnarch and incumbent leader Elefthérios Venizélos, having sidelined the opposition with his popular reforms rules with a velvet glove.\n\nHowever the abysmal economic situation, the slow economic withering of Smyrna and Hellenization policies have caused wide unrest within our country. Elections are coming, and only time will tell what will happen to the Nation of the Hellenes."

Fiercely supportive of Valkism, the Hellenic National Socialist Party seeks to copy its German counterpart in organizational and policy terms, but offer an unique version of Valkism in which it would seek to “restore National Unity, Social Solidarity and Discipline as a means of achieving the fuller moral and material well-being of the people”.§!"

#GRE_vanguardist_party_long:0 "Kommounistikó Archeiomarxistikó Kómma Elládas \n§gThe Communist Archio-Marxist Party of Greece is a communist political party in Greece, active from 1934. It belongs to a subgenre of Marxism–Leninism and Trotskyism known as Archeio-Marxism (Archive-Marxism) and appears to have been the last scion of that ideology. Its leader, Dimitrios Giotopoulos, also known by his primary alias "Witte", is the leader of the KAKE. Before its formation, he had been a leader of the Greek Archio-Marxists, which had been one of the by far largest dissident communist movements in Greece during the early-to-mid-1930s, as members of Leon Trotsky's "Left Opposition". KAKE split from Trotsky's movement in 1934 after significant ideological fallout. While overshadowed by the major Communist Party, KAKE continues its activites as it waits for the proper moment to assert itself as the true successor of socialism, even though rumors claim that Giotopoulos is collaborating with the right.§!"

##### Leader Description ####
POLITICS_PAPANASTASIOU_DESC:0 "Papanastasiou was born on 8 July 1876 in Tripoli. He studied law at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. From 1901 to 1905 he studied social sciences, law, and philosophy in Germany. In 1910 Papanastasiou was elected to the Greek Parliament for the first time. In 1916, he has joined the Provisional Government of National Defence in Thessaloniki. After the election crisis, he and other anti-monarchists published a document entitled The Republican-Democratic Manifesto. Over the following years, his list of actions targetting the supporters of the monarchy only grew. In 1935, he was elected Prime Minister of Greece. Papanastasiou announced a series of reforms, but it is unclear whether the Liberal party would remain in power for necessarily long, as the opposition to the liberals is growing every year."

POLITICS_ALEXANDROS_Z_DESC:0 "He was born in Athens and was the son of Thrasyvoulos Zaimis, a former Prime Minister of Greece, and Eleni Mourouzi. His brother was Asimakis Zaimis. On his father's side he was the grandson of Andreas Zaimis, another former Prime Minister of Greece, and related to the great Kalavrytan family with notable participation in the Greek War of Independence from 1821. From his mother's side he was a descendant of an important Fanariote family of the Mourozidon. His family lived in Kerpini, Kalavryta in the Achaia prefecture.\nHe studied law at the University of Athens and at the University of Heidelberg. He also attended the universities of Leipzig, Paris and Berlin.\nIn 1929 he was elected senator and then president of the Senate. With the resignation of Koundouriotis on December 9, 1929, Eleftherios Venizelsos nominated Alexandros Zaimis as the next President of the Republic. Papanastasiou and Argyropoulos opposed Zaimi's candidacy. Venizelos justified his choice for the person of Zaimis that he came from a historical family. He was also not always democratic, but he was a moderate conservative. During the voting in the joint session of the two Legislatures held at 11 in the morning of December 14, 1929, 101 senators voted out of a total of 120 and 226 deputies out of a total of 250, Zaimis was elected with 257 votes."

##### Events #####
gre.0.t:"The Second Hellenic Republic"
gre.0.d:"Greece emerged victorious from the 1912-1913 Balkan Wars with her territory almost doubled, but found itself in a difficult international situation. In 1914 another danger would emerge from the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, in which Greece was allied with Serbia. Initially neutral, Venizelos supported participation with the Entente while the King anticipated a German victory. This led to a power struggle between Liberals and Royalists. The State of National Defence was established in Thessaloniki to fight alongside the Allies. The year 1916 saw the death of prominent right-wing politician Dimitrios Gounaris, a disaster for the anti-Venizelist parties. The division of the country lasted 9 months, as an Allied ultimatum forced the King and the Royal Family to flee to Switzerland.\nVenizelos returned to Athens, as head of a reunified Greece. In 1920 the greek legislative elections happened. The liberal party gathered the majority of votes and seats in parliament. After the humiliating loss, the anti-Venizelists gathered in Athens and stormed the parliament. At the same time, violent Turkish protests in Smyrna began. The coup ended two days later with Entente treating to intervene and leadership recognizing the failure. In Smyrna, greek soldiers and police cut from communication and radicalized by the Turkish atrocities started shooting at the protestors. Greek citizens started destroying the houses and shops of the Turks, this became known as the night of broken glass. The republic soon took control of the situation but what was done is done. Both the Greeks and Turks of Smyrna became extremely radicalized. \nThe following years saw success for Venizelos' Liberal Party, securing the majority in every election. However the economic situation couldn't be worse, as Smyrna doesn't have access to the raw materials of deep Anatolia and needs to rely on the other side for economic support, debts are skyrocketing and unrest starts to grow within the population. It's 1936 and with the rise of Ultranationalism, the Hellenic Republic is in a weak position. Will the nation of the Hellenes withstand all odds?"
gre.0.a:"Okay, enough, I know what I'm doing"
gre.0.b:"This is my first time playing as Greece"

gre.1.t:"The Challenges Ahead"
gre.1.d:"The Second Hellenic Republic, which faces another election in 1936, has to deal with several challenges, the most prominent of which is anti-venizelist sentiment, which could cause a political crisis all over again. Most are confident that war will soon break out again, with the Ottomans demanding the return of territories lost after the Great War.  The Golden Dawn Ultranationalists are also on the rise, with mass hatred of the Turks among Greeks.\n\nAs the government of Greece, you will have to control the influence of the Golden Dawn, you can do this in the decisions tab. The more influence the ultranationalists have on the country, the greater the chance of a coup. There is no doubt that the Greek-Turkish conflict will start soon, so the sooner you start preparing the better. The most important issue, however, is the economic crisis, it will crush you if you try to ignore it!"

gre.2.d:0 "In 1821, Greeks rose up against the oppressive Ottoman Empire, which had occupied Greece for nearly four hundred years. Bishop Germanos of Patras boldly raised the Greek flag at the monastery of Agia Lavras, inciting the Greek revolution. While the exact date probably was not March 25th, it did occur in late March and it was gradually associated with the religious feast of the Annunciation which occurs on the same date. On the day of the Feast of the Annunciation the archangel Gabriel appeared to the maiden Mary and announced the news, she was pregnant with the divine child. Bishop Germanos chose this day to deliver a different but not unrelated message, a new spirit was about to be born in Greece."
gre.2.a:0 "A new spirit shall be born again!"

gre.3.d:0 "Independence Day is celebrated once again in [Root.GetNameDef], with crowds lining the streets in Athens and other cities, all waving the Greek flag and singing 'Ýmnos is tin Eleftherían' - the Hymn to Freedom, and the country's national anthem.

gre.16.d:0 "The Continental Entente has finalized sending 1000 rifles to our Army. It is less than we anticipated but it will definitely help us in the war effort."
gre.16.a:0 "OK"

gre.11.t:0 "To Make an Example"
gre.11.d:0 "Devrim Tanse is an Ottoman Spy that enlisted in the Greek army only to backstab us by sending intel to the Sultanate. Thankfully he was quickly arrested by an actual Greek patriot. Today will be the end of his life and the beginning of horror in the hearts of the traitors!"
gre.11.a:0 "We had no choice"

gre.12.t:0 "The Nationalist Militia Problem"
gre.12.d:0 "Today is the day we possibly decide about our fate. The Golden Dawn militia has unofficially been our allies against The Empire for a very long time. This status quo has existed for a decent number of years already but it cannot anymore. The Golden Dawn demands our action now. Should we risk democracy and integrate them into our armed forces or shut them up with some weapons and and hope Greece survives the next few decades."
gre.12.a:0 "Fuck the risk, bring me the Golden Dawn leaders here!"
gre.12.b:0 "Give them some weapons and better pray that they forget about this whole mess"

gre.4.t:0 "The Elections"
gre.4.d:0 "The much-awaited national election has finally arrived. Soon the results were published and the winner turned out to be..."
gre.4.a:0 "...The National Unionist Party"
gre.4.b:0 "...The Liberal Party"
gre.4.c:0 "...The Populist Party"
gre.4.e:0 "...The Freethinkers' Party"
gre.4.f:0 "...The Socialist Labour Party of Greece"

gre.6.t:0 "The Return of The King!"
gre.6.d:0 "Just as we promised our Great King George II has returned to Greek soil after a long time in exile. Long live the King! Long live Greece!"
gre.6.a:0 "The end of the republic"

gre.7.t:0 "'Wait, What?'"
gre.7.d:0 "Today a military garrison in Smyrna has received a bizarre offer from our "friends" in the Golden Dawn. They have offered a handful of military equipment for a meager price. They ignored all questions about how they even got them. What should we do with this offer? We don't even know how they got all this stuff!"
gre.7.a:0 "Every gun matters for our army!"
gre.7.b:0 "No, just NO."

gre.8.t:0 "Youthful Stupidity"
gre.8.d:0 "An unexpected problem has emerged in Greek cities. The walls of many buildings are filled with nationalist symbols and propaganda. At this point, young people are running away from school only to contribute to acts of vandalism. This seems to be a minor issue, but this year we have seen a significant increase in support for Golden Dawn. Should we intervene?"
gre.8.a:0 "We have to do something!"
gre.8.b:0 "I don't care"

gre.20.t:0 "An Interesting Proposition"
gre.20.d:0 "Ever since we crushed the Ottoman madness we have had problems managing the various rebellions in our territories in Anatolia. This problem has become even more apparent as the war is getting closer. But the solution to this problem may be simpler than we think - let's ask Golden Dawn for help! Yes, they may not be the best of friends, but this time we need someone to do what we cannot do more than ever."
gre.20.a:0 "Fine"
gre.20.b:0 "Just divert more resources to the police"

gre.13.t:0 "An Another Day in Thessaloniki"
gre.13.d:0 "The city of Thessaloniki has a large Jewish minority and, of course, with it, there are unfortunately anti-Semitic tendencies. Acts of violence against people of other nationalities are the order of the day here. We found evidence of Golden Dawn's intervention in this problem. Today another boundary was crossed. Two thugs tried to start a fire in a synagogue while shouting pro-Golden Dawn sentences. The worst thing is that there were witnesses to this situation and if the media finds out about it, we are really screwed."
gre.13.a:0 "Try to censor as much as you can and don't let the Golden Dawn get angry"
gre.13.b:0 "Blame it all on the Golden Dawn. I'm sick of this shit"

gre.14.t:0 "Hail Zeus!"
gre.14.d:0 "No one has treated the Ancient Greek religion seriously. No one will ever think about taking it back from the land of death, right? Wrong. The "Association of Hellenism" is growing every year. They have gathered all the known ancient beliefs and compressed them into one religious canon called "Hellenism". Maybe we should recognize our ancient beliefs as an official religion in Greece? On the other hand, the Christian majority of Greece could get very angry with our recognition. "
gre.14.a:0 "Come on, we can convince Christians of our good will"
gre.14.b:0 "You'd better find a good psycho facility for them instead"

gre.15.t:0 "The End"
gre.15.d:0 "We have made a mistake. A mistake that will cost thousands of lives. Golden Dawn has stormed government buildings in Athens, effectively taking control of the city. A few hours and the Republic will be gone. We can't fight anymore. Soldiers loyal to the Republic will start guerrilla warfare against the nationalists. The Entente knows about the situation, but it looks like it is not in their interest to intervene."
gre.15.a:0 "Glory to the Greek Underground State!"

crisis.1.t:0 "The End of the Free Zone"
crisis.1.d:0 "Today marks the end of the absolute mistake known as the International Strait Zone! An agreement has been concluded that will divide the zone into two parts. One Greek and one Turkish. Of course, this will certainly cause a lot of diplomatic mess, but the annexation of Constantinople will help our economy and position on the world stage."
crisis.1.a:0 "We are one step closer to the unification!"

crisis.2.t:0 "The First Victim of an Upcoming War"
crisis.2.d:0 "Under cover of darkness, a group of Turkish soldiers crossed the border into Greece robbing a local village and killing one person to scare the others. They were long gone by the time our boys arrived. The Ottoman government said the whole situation had been staged and was a Greek provocation. Both countries are currently remilitarizing territories that were supposed to be demilitarized by the treaty."
crisis.2.a:0 "The truth is we all knew what was coming"

crisis.3.t:0 "A Stab in the Back"
crisis.3.d:0 "The Turkish bastards did it, the Ottoman army entered the Greek territory of Smyrna without a declaration of war and began to fulfil their bloodlust! Artillery barrages attacking our cities have already begun. The civilian population has been ordered to stay in their homes or local civilian fortifications. Every man capable of committing to the war effort must report to the mobilization office. We can no longer expect any help from the Entente, we are on our own."
crisis.3.a:0 "Freedom or death!"

gre.18.t:0 "In Search of the Hyperborea"
gre.18.d:0 "Hyperborea is, or was, a land free of disease and suffering, a land where people committed suicide after feeling fulfilled because nothing else could end their lives. The Hyperboreans lived a life where you effortlessly got everything you wanted. Everything here was perfect, everyone was perfect. As relatives and successors of these people, we shall learn their secrets. A significant portion of the funds will be directed toward research. It has also been decided that there will be an expedition to the land of the north, Greenland. Perhaps we will find the Hyperboreans alive and well there?"
gre.18.a:0 "Lets hope"

GRE_abysmal_economy_desc:0 "As if anything else couldn't be worse, our economic situation has been downright horrendous. Deficit is growing, debts still remain unpaid and our workers slowly starting to grow inpatient. Years of expenditure for the army has caused our industries to crumble, our shops closing with a feeling of uncertainty looming over the horizon. Truly and regretfully, we are bankrupt, again...."
GRE_economic_withering_of_smyrna:0 "Economic Withering of Smyrna"
GRE_economic_withering_of_smyrna_desc:0 "Smyrna, the jewel of the Near East, is our most precious possesion since our victory in the Greco-Turkish war. Of course, with any victory comes the price. Since the Turks refuse to export their resources to the ports of Anatolia, the city as well as the whole region have begun to see a period of economic withering and in constant need of economic support, coming straight out of our pockets."
GRE_minority_unrests:0 "Minority Unrests"
GRE_minority_unrests_desc:0 "Our country as a whole consists of many ethnicities, such as the Slavic speakers in Macedonia, the Albanians in Epirus and the Muslims in Anatola and Eastern Thrace. Although cooperative, our recent attempts to Hellenize the populace has been seen with hostile reaction, with many openly rebelling. Solutions must be found if we ever wish to truly integrate them into our society."

As long as the Republic stands, the officer corps stand ready to assist the goverment in all manners concerning the protection and the expansion of the state."

GRE_anathema_desc:0 "Even though the Liberals enjoy wide support, there are also many who wish to see its downfall. From Conservatives to Valkists, to Socialists and Communists, Venizelos and his allies are seen as a huge obstacle to their schemes of gaining power. Only through proper maneuvering and proper measures will we ever put an end to this political bickering."
GRE_golden_dawn:0 "The Golden Dawn"
GRE_golden_dawn_desc:0 "The Golden Dawn Organization was founded in Smyrna in 1920 after the election crisis and the "Night of the Broken Glass". The Party is very divided inside, but one thing holding them together is hatred towards the Turks. This fact makes the Golden Dawn a precious asset for the Greek Government in the struggle against the Ottomans. Giving the ultranationalists too much power, however, might not be the best idea."
