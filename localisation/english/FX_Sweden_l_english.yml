SWE_unbroken_neutrality_idea_desc:0 "Sweden has, since 1814, been a country at peace. No wars since then has touched the Kingdom, and has continued to stay neutral even when the world around it burned."

SWE_sluggish_economy_idea:0 "Sluggish Economy"
SWE_sluggish_economy_idea_desc:0 "The Valkist overthrow of the German Republic, our biggest economic partner since the Great War, had a sour impact on the Swedish economy.

#### EVENTS ####
sweden.0.t:0 "The Status of Sweden"
sweden.0.d:0 "From the ending days of the Napoleonic wars, Sweden has reserved itself from involvement in foreign conflicts. Even when Norway left the union between the two countries in 1905 and a war dipped Europe in blood, Sweden managed to remain neutral.\n\nEven with this neutrality, it was clear that Sweden was internationally leaning in favour of the Central Powers and Germany. While Sweden never joined the fighting, they had no problem in supplying Germany with Swedish steel and other materials. Likewise, the Entente had no problem to use this fact to extend the North Sea Blockade to include Sweden as well.\n\n1917 became one of the most troublesome years in recent Swedish history. With the blockade causing a crisis, with austerity and rationing being implemented, revolutions was soon in the air. As Russia fell to revolution, Sweden would soon see itself nearing one as well. The Swedish Revolution of 1917 failed as soon as it started. But the aftermath of it would grip the country through political polarization and resentment between the right and the left.\n\nThe end of the Great War would mean the end of the North Sea Blockade. Sweden came out of this era acquiring the Åland islands and a modest resentment against the Entente powers. Through the 1920s and early 1930s, Sweden would continue with a pro-German line on foreign and trade policy, with little trading with France or the United Kingdom. This economical dependency on Germany would smite Sweden as the Valkist takeover in Germany severed economical ties between the countries, leading to a new economic crisis.\n\nAs the situation worsened, King Gustaf V appointed general Carl Gustaf Hammarskjöld as prime minister in an attempt to stabilize the nation. While this was the intention, the result would be far different, with a rise of political tensions and a more defiant left-wing. The political tensions would manifest itself in the May Day incident of 1935, where the government reacted brutally against a May Day protest. While Sweden still is tored by crisis, many believes the Hammarskjöld government's days are numbered."
sweden.0.a:0 "För Sverige - i tiden!"
sweden.1.t:0 "6th of June"
sweden.1.d:0 "While Sweden has no official national holiday, 6th of June is often seen as a unofficial day to celebrate. This day marks the day when Sweden, under king Gustav Vasa, became independent from the Kalmar Union in 1523. The day also marks the day when, in 1809, a new Swedish constitution granted more power to Ståndsriksdagen, when Karl XIII became king of Sweden."
sweden.1.a:0 "Maybe we need a National Holiday?"
sweden.2.t:0 "6th of June"
sweden.2.d:0 "While Sweden has no official national holiday, 6th of June is often seen as a unofficial day to celebrate. This day marks the day when Sweden, under king Gustav Vasa, became independent from the Kalmar Union in 1523.

sweden.2.a:0 "Maybe we need a National Holiday?"
sweden.3.t:0 "Kurt Haijby Claims to be the King's Lover."
sweden.3.d:0 "A native of the capital, Stockholm, named Kurt Haijby has come out and claimed to be king Gustaf V's lover, and that the king seduced him back in 1933. The rumors have already begun to spread with those closest to Haijby. We must act fast before this will turn into a scandal and an embarishment for our king."
sweden.3.a:0 "He have his freedom of expression."
sweden.3.b:0 "We need to try to bribe him."
sweden.3.c:0 "Find a way to assassinate him."
sweden.4.t:0 "The Opening of Stockholm Bromma Airport"
sweden.4.d:0 "During the 1930s has the need for Stockholm to get a proper airport, become urgent. But today, the Stockholm Bromma Airport was opened by the king himself. This will hopefully be the start of Stockholm air traffic."
sweden.4.a:0 "First in Europe to be Paved from the Start of."
sweden.5.t:0 "Salaligan has committed another murder"
sweden.5.d:0 "A criminal gang, Salaligan or Sala gang, that has been suspected of doing a few murders since 1930 until today has done it again. The police are investigating, and would always be happy if someone gave them a tip on where the criminals might be."
sweden.5.a:0 "We will see to take them!"
sweden.6.t:0 "Members of Salaligan Arrested"
sweden.6.d:0 "After the police received a tip, it has lead them to arrest the members of the Sala gang. Finally there will be some peace in and around Sala."
sweden.6.a:0 "Excellent!"

sweden.7.t:0 "The London Crash hits Sweden"
sweden.7.d:0 "We have gotten the news of the London Stock Market Crash, and with it, the crash itself. Since we have been one of the trading partners to the British, we will now feel the crisis that will follow this. We just have to embrace ourelves and hope that Sweden will recover."
sweden.7.a:0 "Oh no. No."
sweden.8.t:0 "Per Engdahl Blames the Establishment for the Crash"
sweden.8.d:0 "The far-right politican, Per Engdahl, came to Rikstagen this morning and held a speech outside for all to hear. The spooke of that the 'Establishment' has brought the economic crisis upon Sweden. He claimed that to get over this, the people of Sweden needed to vote on someone that will set the people, nation, and the military and industrial might first. Engdahl's movement, Nysvenska Rörelsen, has been working with the SNF/KFp Coalition, and the three party has formed a triplealliance in the Parliament, making them a powerful opposition."
sweden.8.a:0 "So he believe he can fix this?"
sweden.9.t:0 "Sven Linderot's Demand to the Voters"
sweden.9.d:0 "The day after Per Engdahl's speech, the far-left politican, Sven Linderot, held a speech in the industrial center of Stockholm. There he encouraged the people to not listen on what far-right politicans was saying, by claiming: "The far-right is in cahoots with the oppressive corporations. We shall give the power back to the people.". The establishment has been worried of far-left activities, with many conservatives choosing to align for a more nationalist and authoritarian path. What Linderot said could make moderate conservatives more willing to enter coalition with more right-winged radical parties."
sweden.9.a:0 "Don't force voters to vote Marxist!"

sweden.10.t:0 "The 1936 Swedish general election"
sweden.10.d:0 "With the London Crash still fresh in people's mind, they have gone to vote. Many experts says that this might be Sweden's most important election in it's history, with individuals and groups both on the left and the right nearly fighting for power. There are three possible outcomes: \n\nA leftwing coaltion between socialists and social democrats, with the social democratic party, Sveriges Socialdemokratiska Parti, as the leaders of the coalition. They are also able to get support from the far-left and centre, and may get extra support from individuals that have left the conservatives. \n\nA centre-right coalition between the liberals and conservatives, with the conservative party, Allmänna Valmansförbundet, as leaders of the coalition. There are a chance for them to get support from agrarians and nationalists. But the conservatives are playing a uphill battle, with many leaving them as the day goes. \n\nThe last option that is on the table is the far-right coalition gaining power. The ideologies of Swedish nationalism and newswedishness has struck into the heart of many swedes. Many feels that those ruling Sweden today tries to contain the country's power. While the far-right are somewhat united under Nysvenska Rörelsen, there are some divisions between factions, and their path to power might need help from other parties. Some believes that the conservatives will support this to hinder a social democratic victory."
sweden.10.a:0 "Socialdemokraterna is the Victor"
sweden.10.b:0 "Allmänna Valmansförbundet Manage to Hold On"
sweden.10.c:0 "Nysvenska Rörelsen Gains Support"

sweden.11.t:0 "Socialdemokraterna forms government"
sweden.11.d:0 "The Social democrats are now ready to from the next government. With the blessing of the king, this would hopefully begin a time of peace and stability."
sweden.11.a:0 "A New Government is Ready!"
sweden.12.t:0 "The Conservatives forms government"
sweden.12.d:0 "While Valmansförbundet managed to hold on to their popularity in the recent election, they are far from a workable majority to govern the nation. This problem has, however, a solution. Actually two solutions.. Either we can choose to approach the liberal Folkpartiet and the agrarian Bondeförbundet to aquire the support needed, a move that might alienate the more authoritarian section of our party. Or, we can try to approach Nysvenska Rörelsen in a hope to keep them under control, while holding on to our radical wing."
sweden.12.a:0 "We Can't Work With the New Sweden Movement"
sweden.12.b:0 "Let Us Try to Work With the New Sweden Movement"

sweden.13.t:0 "The New Swedish Movement Protest the Election Result"
sweden.13.d:0 "Nysvenska Rörelsen has taken to the street to protest the result. While the election seems to be fair, there is many Swedes on this end of the political spectrum that would either believe othervise, or starting a revolt."
sweden.13.a:0 "We need to strengthen us against them!"
sweden.14.t:0 "The Far-Left Political Parties Protest the Election Result"
sweden.14.d:0 "The far-left political parties has taken to the street to protest the result. While the election seems to be fair, there is many Swedes on this end of the political spectrum that would either believe that it is favoring a ruling elite and oppressing the workers."
sweden.14.a:0 "We Want no Revolution in Sweden!"

sweden.15.t:0 "Far-Left Protests Escalates!"
sweden.15.d:0 "The first May-day demonstration was held in Sweden in 1890. While it is not a recognized holiday, most of the political left want to see it become one. \n\nWhile these demonstration has been tame in Sweden, this year was it an full on attack on the newly elected government. Collectivist, socialists and even social democrats, like Nils Flyg, Per-Albin Hansson and Sven Linderot, has used this day to fuel the rebellious working class that does not seem to find our government anything of attractive. \n\nThe Police was sent out to many places to break up these demonstrations, but it may have strengthen the socialist revolution."
sweden.15.a:0 "Why Does we not Take them Down?!"
sweden.16.t:0 "Swedish Revolutionaries Ask for Support"
sweden.16.d:0 "The Swedish revolutionary, Hugo Sillén, has arrived Leningrad with an request. He is sent by the leaders of the SKP in Sweden with the message of help in supplying them with equipment and volunteers to start a collectivist revolution in Sweden. \n\nWhile this can be a one in a time chance to let the marxist revolution be planted in Scandinavia, some of our leaders do not want to use valuable ressourses into it, if it is doomed to fail."
sweden.16.a:0 "Let's Support This!"
sweden.16.b:0 "No. Let's Not do it."
sweden.17.t:0 "Far-Left Protests Deescalate!"
sweden.17.d:0 "Good news have arrived regarding the May-Day protests.

sweden.420.d:0 "In 1814, directly following the wake of the Napoleonic wars, Sweden gained control of the kingdom of Norway and the two entered a personal union which would last until 1905. Sweden-Norway remained neutral in nearly all conflicts of the later 19th century but during this time it cemented itself as one of the richest nations in Europe with one of the continents highest standard of living. This blissful isolation has been chalenged several times though. Sweden-Norway refused to support Denmark in their war against Prussia in 1864 which would permanently damaged support for a united Scandinavia. After nearly a century together Sweden and Norway dissolved the union in 1905 on good terms. \n\nRelations between the Nordic nations have remained good until the socialist party "Arbeiderpartiet" took power in Norway and ousted the Royal Family in a controversial referendum. Coming out of the ashes of the failed revolution in Sweden, Swedish conservatives rallied together against this new ideological enemy. For the last decade tensions in northern Europe have been high and in the wake of the London Stock Crash have finally reached a boiling point. The war between out nations was brutal but the Swedes have come out victorious over the revolutionaries and for the first time since 1905 our nations are one. In this ever changing world we must be strong to survive. A united Scadinavia will be too powerful for any nation to overcome! Shall we reform the union between our glorious states?"

swenews.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]During the Great War, Norway found themselves in a precarious position to say the least. The War ended up opening a rift between the classes of Norway, notably the Upper-class and Lower-class. Many resorted to the teachings of Karl Marx, and following a major Strike gone violent in Olso, the Arbeiderpartiet (Labour Party) pulled a large majority in the following elections. A referendum on the abolition of the monarchy was soon held, and a 52.1% saw it through… Much to the dissatisfaction of their neighbors. \n\nJust recently after the Victory of the Nationalist/Loyalist Coalition in Sweden; it has become apparent that Sweden has looked to break their policy of neutrality. Campaigning against Socialism in Scandinavia, Gustaf V is eager to demonstrate that Sweden is willing to meet Socialists with force."
