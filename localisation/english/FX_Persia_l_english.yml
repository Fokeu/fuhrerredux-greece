PER_FUHRERREDUX_DESC:0 "Iran has for many years been under military rule, after the fall of the Qajar dynasty in 1922. The country has modernized in many areas, but it is also a country that is nearly powerless to do anything about the British influencing and nearly controlling the lands of Iran.\n\nBut with new challenges approaching Britain, Iran may be able to rid themselves of British influence and control. Either under continued military rule or another regime."

#### EVENTS ####

iran.0.t:0 "The State of Iran in 1936"
iran.0.d:0 "For many years, Persia, now referred to as Iran, has been in a decline. While modernization of the country began in the 1800s, British and Russian influence began to grow. At the end of the century, many in Persia believed that their rulers were beholden to foreign interests. At the start of the 20th century, Persia became a constitutional monarchy after the Persian Constitutional Revolution. Elections were introduced in Persia soon after. \n\nDuring the Great War, Persia announced its neutrality in the conflict. However, this did not stop the Ottomans from invading the country. During the invasion, parts of the country were under the influence and control of Russia, and Russian forces were present. In Iranian Azerbaijan, clashes began between Ottoman and Russian forces, the latter of them were aided by Assyrian and Armenian volunteer units. However, with the advent of the Russian Revolution, the Ottomans gained the upper hand in Persia. Under the war, many thousands of the Assyrian and Armenian population in Persia was massacred by Ottoman troops. British forces were also occupying parts of the country during the war. The occupying forces were seen as a major cause for the Great Persian famine of 1917 - 1919 that struck the country. \n\nAfter the war, the British tried to establish a protectorate in Iran, but this operation was unsuccessful. While the war was over, the population of Iran was filled with discontent and hatred towards the ruling government. In 1922, a socialist rebellion rose up capturing Tehran and forcing the Qajar royal family to flee from the country. But before a socialist republic could be established, the majority of the Persian army, under the leadership of Reza Khan, Along British support, crushed the rebellion. While some believed that this would lead to the restoration of the royal family, the military took over under the leadership of Reza Khan. Like that, the age of Persian monarchs was over. \n\nThe new military regime modernized Persia and built railways throughout the country. But while all of this happened, the Persian military was cracking down and silencing socialist elements in Persia. Many conservative voices were not happy either when the regime worked to separate religion and state, even adopting Western clothes. In 1933, the country changed its official name to Iran. \n\nThe last 20 years have also seen the regime balancing between favoring both the British Empire and Iranian nationalists. With rebellions rising up in India, it remains to be seen if it is time for Iran to continue under the military regime, adopt a more democratic system, or be consumed by socialist or nationalist revolutions."

Those voicing for such change claim that our laws are old and unmodern, an artifact from the age of the Qajar dynasty. But there are also those that say that adopting western laws gives a signal of defeat to European colonialists."
iran.119.a:0 "We Should Adopt Western Laws"
iran.119.b:0 "No. We Should hold on to our own Laws"

iran.120.t:0 "Conservatives Flock to Us"
iran.120.d:0 "With the limitation of progressive ideals, conservatives have been more eagerly to support us. We welcome them, of course, and hope that they will help us in turning Iran in the right direction."
iran.120.a:0 "That's Nice"

iran.121.t:0 "Moderates Rally Towards the Left"

iran.121.a:0 "Let Them Do Their Things"

iran.122.t:0 "The Question About Shia Law Code"
iran.122.d:0 "There have been talks about adopting a Shia law code. Those who support it say there are many things in Shiite Islam that could be good for laws. There are also those that see this move as a way to bring religion into governing, and are therefore a little skeptical."
iran.122.a:0 "We Should Hold on to our Shia Laws"
iran.122.b:0 "No Religion in our Law Code"

iran.123.t:0 "Election for a Civilian Government"
iran.123.d:0 "Mohammad Reza Khan has finally chosen to hold democratic elections. So long as he will stay as head of state, he has allowed democratic parties to stand in an election. This will mark the end of military rule in Iran."
iran.123.a:0 "The Iran Party Wins!"
iran.123.b:0 "The Edalat Party Wins!"

iran.124.t:0 "Election for a Civilian Government"

iran.124.a:0 "The Revival Party Wins!"
iran.124.b:0 "The Democrat Party Wins!"

iran.125.t:0 "The General Election of [GetYear]"
iran.125.d:0 "With the Republic in place, we are ready to hold elections. This first election after the establishment of the republic has seen two possible winners. At the one hand, the Tudeh party can win, forming a coalition with other socialist and far-left forces. And on the other hand we can see Mohammad Mosaddegh and the Iran party manage to form a center to left coalition. Who has won this election?!"
iran.125.a:0 "The Tudeh Party Wins!"
iran.125.b:0 "Mossadegh's Coalition Wins!"

iran.126.t:0 "What Doctrine of Rule to Follow?"
iran.126.d:0 "With the old military regime finally gone, we need to figure out what doctrine of rule we should follow. Some have requested a ultra-conservative Islamic state, while others find inspiration in Germany and argue for a valkist regime instead."
iran.126.a:0 "A Conservative Shia State is Best"
iran.126.b:0 "A New Iran Will Rise!"

iran.127.t:0 "Iran Supports Iranian Rebels"
iran.127.d:0 "The government of Iran have begun to support Iranian rebels. While they do not say this, we can see where the support comes from."
iran.127.a:0 "Damn you, Iran!"

iran.128.t:0 "Building Our Identity!"
iran.128.d:0 "Iran needs an identity. One that is different from the Arabs or Turks. But with almost the same religion between us, who could manage to see Iranian as a identity of its own. But when we go back, before Islam was forced upon us, we find Zoroastrianism. This could be what can define our new identity."
iran.128.a:0 "The Zoroastrian Empire of Persia is a Good Place to Look Back on"
